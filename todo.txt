- Consider merging the ExpiringView with LiteMap:
	+ It would allow for a much more efficient garbage collector.
	- If you really need something of such high performance then just custom
	  make something.
- Consider being able to watch mutable objects for changes, or to write back
  everything that is read at the end of a "transaction".
- Consider abstracting out the engine so that we can use sqlite or bsddb.
- Consider adding a lock(exclusive=False) method so we can avoid deadlocks in
  some circumstances. This could return a context object which will unlock on
  exit.
